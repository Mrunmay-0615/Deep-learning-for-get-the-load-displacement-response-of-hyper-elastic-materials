# Deep-learning-for-get-the-load-displacement-response-of-hyper-elastic-materials

The repository contains jupyter notebooks corresponding the neural network solutions of the deformation of hyperelastic materials subjected to certain loading conditions:

* AxialBar1D_Linearly_Elastic.ipynb: A linearly-elastic axial-bar
* 2DBeamv5 (3).ipynb: Cantilever Beam
* AxialBar_StrongForm.ipynb: Solution with using the strong form
* Axial_Bar_Weak_Form (1).ipynb: Solution using the weak form
* FSB_Pytorch (1).ipynb: A Beam fixed at both the ends
